Description Documenting a cybersecurity incident

Tools used : None.

The 5 W's
● Who    : An organized group of unethical hackers
● What   : A ransomware security incident
● Where  : At a health care company
● When   : Tuesday 9:00 a.m.
● Why    : The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to
           access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining
           access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's
           systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to
           be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum
           of money in exchange for the decryption key.
